# Econ Recycling Behavior – Field Experiment
# Analyzing Recycling Behavior at NUS

## Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of behavioral interventions aimed at improving recycling behavior at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Using data from a multi-phase field trial, the analysis examines whether design changes to recycling bins reduced contamination rates across recyclable materials.

---

## Objective
The primary goal is to assess whether:
- Shaped bin openings (Phase 2)
- Informational banners (Phase 3)

led to statistically and practically meaningful improvements in recycling behavior relative to the baseline.

---

## Experimental Design
The trial consists of three phases:
1. **Phase 1:** Baseline (no intervention)
2. **Phase 2:** Introduction of shaped bin openings
3. **Phase 3:** Addition of informational banners

Data was collected at two locations:
- ENGINE
- UTOWN

---

## Dataset
**Source:** `Project2Data.xls`

Variables include:
- Contamination rates for paper, plastic, and cans
- Location identifiers
- Experimental phase indicators

---

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis by phase, material, and location
- Before-after and cross-phase comparisons
- Regression-based evaluation of intervention effects
- Visualization of contamination trends

The analysis was performed using Python.

## Key Findings
- Shaped openings reduced contamination for certain materials
- Informational banners provided additional, but heterogeneous, improvements
- Effects varied by location and material type

---

## Practical Implications
The findings offer evidence-based guidance for designing recycling infrastructure in institutional settings.

## Notes
This project was completed as a group assignment. Any use of LLMs during the analysis is documented in the report.
